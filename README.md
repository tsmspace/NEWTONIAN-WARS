# NEWTONIAN-WARS
open-source story project

The concept of this story project is to create outlines for space battles that took place in Star Wars, re-imagined with rocket thrust physics. 

For example, during the attack on the Death Star trench, the stunt-fighters must accelerate to attack speed to approach the station at a velocity that makes them difficult to hit with turret fire, then they must duck into the trench at this velocity, meaning they would have been circling in an orbit low to the station surface already, then they must fly down the trench while hugging the curvature of the station, then they must flip-and-burn in order to come to a complete stop which will allow them to try to fire a torpedo in a perfectly straight line down the ventilation shaft.
